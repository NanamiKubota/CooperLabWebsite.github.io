Hi! I am Talia Grossman. I am currently working as an undergraduate research assistant in the
Cooper Lab. I also work with the outreach program, evolving stem. I am on track to graduate
from the University of Pittsburgh with a Bachelors in Ecology and Evolution. In my free time I do
service through the environmental fraternity at Pitt, Epsilon Eta and keep reptiles.
