Yasmin completed her PhD studies with Prof Craig Winstanley at the University of Liverpool (UK) where her research focused on the development of resistance and tolerance to disinfectants in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from corneal keratitis infections. Yasmin’s current research is split across the Cooper and Bomberger labs and aims to better understand the impact of acute viral infections on the respiratory tract microbiome in people with cystic fibrosis through the use of shallow shotgun metagenomic sequencing. She aims to integrate patient metadata from longitudinal samples with viral infection data and bacterial community composition changes to identify potential markers of disease progression in cystic fibrosis.
