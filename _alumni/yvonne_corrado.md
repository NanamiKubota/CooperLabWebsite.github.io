Yvonne is the Outreach Program Manager for EvolvingSTEM.  She graduated from Duquesne University with a BS in Biology and a Masters in Secondary Science Education.   Yvonne has 15 years of experience teaching science in the urban secondary classroom setting.  Yvonne’s expertise is in developing and implementing hands-on and interactive inquiry curriculum for preteen and teen learners.   During her time in the classroom she also had the privilege to lead and mentor other teachers to be better hands on science educators as well.  Yvonne is passionate about supporting educators and getting real science in the hands of young people so that they can envision themselves as scientists too!  When she’s not busy taking over the world, Yvonne likes to knit, read, cook, and dote on her two precious kids :)
