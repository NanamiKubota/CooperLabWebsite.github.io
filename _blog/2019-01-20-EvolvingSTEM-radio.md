>And Evolving STEM is a program that uses science and lab experiments to give students a hands-on experience with evolution. As schools across three states – including Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy, a magnet school in Pittsburgh – adopt this approach, educators are asking how teaching evolution should change. Hear from a group involved with the program:

>Vaughn Cooper, evolutionary biologist and director of the University of Pittsburgh’s [Center for Evolutionary Biology and Medicine](http://cebam.pitt.edu), and founder of the [EvolvingSTEM](http://evolvingstem.org) Program;
Edwina Kinchington, teacher at [Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy](https://pittsburghscitech.com);
Mia Perez, junior at Pittsburgh Sci-Tech; and
Sachin Thiagarajan, junior at Pittsburgh Sci-Tech.
