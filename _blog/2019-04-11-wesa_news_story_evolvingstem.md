A local news outlet [wrote a story](https://www.wesa.fm/post/why-area-teachers-are-using-lab-experiments-rather-textbooks-teach-evolution) on the benefits the EvolvingSTEM program grants to students who take the course.

The EvolvingSTEM program has spread to multiple school districts which have found that the hand-on experience provided by EvolvingSTEM has been more engaging and memorable to students than a simple course.
The Cooperlab is an integral part of the program, and has made great strides towards making EvolvingSTEM more accessible to any school district willing to host EvolvingSTEM. 

> “[Vaughn's] goal in my opinion, is he wants to teach the next generation about evolution in an inquiry-based, hands-on way. To help students understand what evolution is whether it’s to get a few more points on the Keystone [standardized exam], or you know just to have the concepts correctly integrated,” Kinchington said.
