Alecia is a graduate student in the Program in Microbiology and Immunology at Pitt. She received her Bachelor of Science in Biology from Lehigh University in 2019. At Lehigh, she was first introduced to microbiology through the SEA-PHAGES program. Her budding interest in microbial evolution led her to join the Lang Lab and work on a project studying non-transitivity of fitness evolution in yeast populations. Specifically, she investigated intracellular viral competitions and the host/virus coevolution of the Killer virus in yeast. Alecia joined the Cooper Lab in 2020 where her thesis work revolves around understanding resistance evolvability in <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>. She is interested in studying how different strains of <i>A. baumannii</i>, including clinical isolates, adapt and evolve in response to antibiotic pressures. In addition to general strain background differences, she is studying interactions between resistance mutations and how specific mutations affect downstream evolvability to different stresses. Her work should help to resolve the genotype-phenotype-fitness map of this high priority pathogen. Alecia is also the point person for the Cooper Labâ€™s in-house sequencing efforts. Outside of the lab, Alecia likes to spend time outside with her two dogs, frequenting local lakes and ponds in the summers. She is equally excited for the winters and the skiing that comes with the snow.
