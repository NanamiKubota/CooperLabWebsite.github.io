Anna is an MD PhD student at the University of Pittsburgh & Carnegie Mellon University studying Computational Biology for her PhD. Her research focuses on using experimental evolution and computational techniques to custom-engineer bacteriophages for Burkholderia lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). She previously worked on CF stem cell therapies in Scott Randell’s lab at UNC-CH from high school throughout undergrad, and then did two gap years in Pradeep Singh’s lab at the University of Washington studying mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and bacterial persistence in the CF lung. When rounding in the hospital, Anna can be seen as a matched set with her golden retriever Winston, who flunked out of service dog school and now thrives as a therapy dog at UPMC. Career-wise, Anna is focused on finding better solutions for cystic fibrosis patients, but also thinking about ways to re-engineer the healthcare system to be more high-quality, equitable and accessible for everyone through technology and humanism. In addition to her CF research, she is a 2023 Paul and Daisy Soros Fellow and a Co-Founder of [Korion Health](https://www.korionhealth.com/).
