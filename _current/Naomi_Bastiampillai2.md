Naomi Bastiampillai is a research technician who received her Bachelor of Science with Honors in Microbiology from the University of Pittsburgh in 2024. As an undergraduate, she performed research in the Cooper Lab under the mentorship of Alecia Rokes, where she explored how the presence of efflux pumps affects the evolutionary pathways taken towards antibiotic resistance in the pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.

Currently, Naomi is studying the use of targeted experimental evolution to develop bacteriophages that can infect a wide range of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> complex isolates to treat antibiotic-resistant infections in cystic fibrosis patients. She is interested in the relationship between microbial/phage evolution and clinical outcomes as well as finding the best methods to engage in scientific communication with various audiences. Naomi would like to pursue an M.D., where she can utilize her research background to help improve health outcomes in a clinical setting. Outside of the lab, she loves to bake, make origami, and write poetry/short stories.
