Anshika is a postdoctoral associate working with Drs. Anna Zemke and Vaughn Cooper. She graduated from the Indian Institute of technology, New Delhi, India (IIT-Delhi) with a bachelors in biochemical engineering. Her curiosity to learn how we can harness microbial physiology to build eco-friendly technologies led her to pursue a PhD in microbiology from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  During her doctoral studies, Anshika delved into the molecular mechanisms of oxidative DNA damage and repair in <i>E. coli</i>. 

In her current role at Pitt, Anshika, she is using microbial genomics and molecular biology to investigate the host-pathogen biology of tracheostomy-associated bronchitis. Outside the lab, Anshika loves to explore national parks and new cuisines around the city.
