Glenn graduated from Saint Vincent College with a BS in Biology. He received his MD and PhD from the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia. During his graduate work, he studied how DNA influences the formation of curli fibrils, an amyloid protein component of the extracellular matrix of E. coli and Salmonella, and the immune responses to amyloid/DNA complexes in the laboratory of Dr. Çagla Tükel. He completed pediatric residency and pediatric infectious diseases fellowship at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. During his clinical fellowship, he worked in Dr. Jennifer Bomberger’s lab where he studied how P. aeruginosa establishes biofilm on airway epithelium and the microbiome in children with cystic fibrosis related chronic rhinosinusitis.

As a physician-scientist, Glenn enjoys studying clinically relevant questions he encounters in the hospital. In the Cooper Lab, Glenn will be studying how P. aeruginosa evolves in the airways of patients with tracheostomy tubes and endotracheal tubes for mechanical ventilation and how the host airway changes because of these breathing devices.

In addition to his lab work, he enjoys his clinical work seeing patients on the Pediatric Infectious Diseases service and teaching medical students and residents at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. He also enjoys cooking, baking, and some gardening. His at home microbiology experiments include home cheese making.
