Luke Crist is an undergraduate researcher at the Cooper Lab, currently completing a Bachelor's Degree in Molecular Biology from the University of Pittsburgh. Upon graduation, he hopes to pursue a career in research and eventually become a biology teacher at the secondary education level. In the lab, he works under the mentorship of Dr. Abigail Matela for the EvolvingSTEM outreach program. This involves visiting public schools throughout the Pittsburgh area and having students replicate bacterial evolution experiments we perform in the lab. Luke hopes that by engaging in this endeavor, he can act as a catalyst for younger people to discover and pursue a scientific interest they didn't know they had.
