Nanami is a PhD student in the Program of Microbiology and Immunology (PMI) at the University of Pittsburgh. She received her bachelor's degree in 2020 from Macaulay Honors College at Queens College, City University of New York (CUNY). 

Nanami is doing her thesis work on understanding how phage genomes integrated in the bacterial chromosome (i.e., prophages) can influence bacterial fitness and community composition. To answer these questions, she works with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and its Pf phage, and dabbles a little bit in evolutionary game theory. Her training goal is to sharpen both her computational and experimental skills for applications in microbial evolution research. 

Outside of the lab, Nanami likes drinking tea and knitting/crocheting. She also has two <s>assistants</s> cats (Cali and Poe) who like to help with her computer work by sitting on the keyboard.
