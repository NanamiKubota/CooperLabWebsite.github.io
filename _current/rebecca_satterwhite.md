Rebecca Satterwhite recently joined Cooper Lab as a postdoctoral associate. She earned her PhD in the lab of Joy Bergelson at the University of Chicago, where she investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying phytopathogen evolution. Prior to her doctoral studies, Rebecca completed her MS in the lab of Tim F. Cooper at the University of Houston, where she conducted research focused on microbial evolution and population genetics. In Vaughn Cooper's Lab, she aims to leverage her expertise to explore the evolutionary dynamics of bacterial pathogens and antibiotics, contributing to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Rebecca is a dedicated researcher with a passion for scientific communication and mentoring the next generation of scientists.
