## Current Opportunities:

We welcome inquiries from creative people interested in evolution, microbiology, genomics, bioinformatics, and scientific outreach. We are an inclusive, interdisciplinary group.

Please send your CV to [Vaughn](mailto:vaughn.cooper@pitt.edu).

### Prospective Ph.D. students are encouraged to apply to one of the graduate training programs in which Vaughn is a mentor:
1. [Program in Microbiology and Immunology](http://www.pmi.pitt.edu)
2. [CMU-Pitt Computational Biology](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu)
3. [Integrated Systems Biology](https://www.isb.pitt.edu)

### Specific postdoctoral research opportunities:

#### Bioinformatics of polymicrobial infections:
We, in collaboration with the [Bomberger lab](http://www.mmg.pitt.edu/lab/bomberger-lab), seek a motivated colleague who shares our interest in defining evolutionary dynamics of bacterial populations during polymicrobial infections of the cystic fibrosis airway. Click [here](http://postdocjobs.hs.pitt.edu/ViewPost.aspx?q=963) for more details.

#### Evolution Curriculum Outreach Coordinator
The Cooper lab is seeking a postdoctoral fellow to oversee the expansion of a project-based curriculum that enables high school students to learn the principles of evolution and heredity with a weeklong evolution experiment in biofilms (EvolvingSTEM, http://evolvingstem.org). EvolvingSTEM utilizes an inquiry based laboratory approach to provide an authentic research experience to students, with the goal of increasing interest in science and gaining the skills and confidence to pursue STEM careers. 

The duties of this position will include: (1) assisting teachers in participating high schools in implementing the EvolvingSTEM curriculum, (2) refining classroom experiments to improve design and implementation, (3) promoting the distribution of the EvolvingSTEM curriculum in the greater Pittsburgh area and beyond, (4) assisting in curriculum development and assessment, and (5) contributing to program fundraising.
