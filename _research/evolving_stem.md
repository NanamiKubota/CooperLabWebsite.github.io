We have developed and direct a program called [EvolvingSTEM](http://www.evolvingstem.org/) that enables hundreds of high school students to learn about evolution and genetics by hands-on research. In one week, students conduct an evolution experiment with the benign biofilm-forming bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, which begins as a clone and ends as an obviously diverse and adapted population. This curriculum increases learning about evolution, ecology, and heredity statistically better than standard non-laboratory-based curricula, it is targeted towards Next-Generation Science Standards, and even increases student motivation to pursue STEM-based careers. It was featured in 5 schools in New Hampshire, two of which continue this curriculum, and is now ongoingat two Pittsburgh-area schools. It is currently supported by a seed award from the Sprout Fund and we seek broader support to refine and distribute this program nationwide.
